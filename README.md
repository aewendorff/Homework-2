# Homework-2
Week 2 homework for quantitative methods in ecology and evolution. Edited by Rebekkah, Victoria, and Aubrey

Objective 2:

We cloned the repo from "Modeling the Feasibility of Reducing Chloride Concentrations in an Urban Lake due to Road Salt Runoff" (https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.70041). We recreated figure #4 with the code, aka "RMSE relationship between observed and modeled chloride with a rolling chloride line". The only change that needed to be made was the location in which the final figure was saved. This was done by changing ggsave('Figures_new/ModelOutput.png', width = 6.5, height = 3, dpi = 500) to ggsave('C:/Users/aubsc/OneDrive/Documents/QuantMeth.png', width = 6.5, height = 3, dpi = 500).
