Aubrey:
I am in the field of aquatic ecology or limnology. For this task, I used a variety of search terms: road salt, chloride, phosphorus, water, urban, Hilary Dugan, and Jacques Finlay. I discovered that 5 out of 10 of the articles I looked at used an open source software (RStudio and GIS), 5 out of 10 used a data repository (Github, Zenodo, FRDR, or EDI), and 5 out of 10 used a public repository for their code (Github, Zenodo, FRDR, or EDI). For the full list of the articles and their corresponding information, use this google sheets link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13p7qnb2ViAvDIRS3vLg7n-C-giYZ4bLPLhDFdLjBFjo/edit?usp=sharing. 

Objective 2:

We cloned the repo from "Modeling the Feasibility of Reducing Chloride Concentrations in an Urban Lake due to Road Salt Runoff" (https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.70041). We recreated figure #4 with the code, aka "RMSE relationship between observed and modeled chloride with a rolling chloride line". The only change that needed to be made was the location in which the final figure was saved. This was done by changing ggsave('Figures_new/ModelOutput.png', width = 6.5, height = 3, dpi = 500) to ggsave('C:/Users/aubsc/OneDrive/Documents/QuantMeth.png', width = 6.5, height = 3, dpi = 500).
